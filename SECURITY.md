## Our Policies

While we continue to develop Ctrl-V++, we think logging user information hinders the capability of an open-source project. WHile beign aimed at makign everything better, certain logging is put in place that can onyl be accessed byt eh developers of the project, none of this information is shared outside of public development and no user information is given out. EVER.
